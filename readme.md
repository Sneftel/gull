# Gull

Gull is a dished ergonomic keyboard. It contains no 3D-printed parts and no hand-wired circuitry, and is designed for rapid constructibility rather than aesthetics. Keys are inserted into thin FR4 PCBs which are bent to the frame.

The raison d'etre of Gull is to be rapidly assembled, tweaked, and remade. The frame is fully parameterized, and changing a parameter generally only requires recutting one shape. The exposed ribbon cables make it potentially impractical for portable use.

The key layout is essentially 3x6 on each side. There are six additional keys per side, two in the bottom center of each side and four (relatively inaccessible) keys at the top corners of each side.

## Tools

The frame for Gull must be cut from acrylic or similar using a laser cutter.

The PCBs have surface-mount components. A hotplate is the best tool for reflow soldering these, but hand soldering is also possible. A hot air can be used, but be aware of temperature limits for the FFC connectors.

## Materials

I use six millimeter-thick acrylic for the frame. Eight millimeter will also work. Below six millimeters is not recommended. Plywood will likely also be acceptable, though I have not tested the most recent shapes with plywood.

The finger and thumb PCBs should be fabricated from 0.8mm-thick FR4. I have not tested other materials or thicknesses. The center PCB should be fabricated from thicker FR4 (I use standard 1.6mm-thick FR4).
